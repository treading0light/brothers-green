# Fantasy Fleet

## A fleet sim game  

Putting out an ad or contacting a hiring agency will provide you (in time)
with an array of possible employees you can hire. Their driver's licence will
be among the items that will be provided. The headshot of each prospective employee will
generated by Dall-e, If they can ever get their API up and going.    

I plan to create a way of randomizing 
the prompt that is given. perhaps when a player first puts out an ad, a list of 4-8 people 
are generated and then presented after a time.

An employee will have the following attributes:

name
age
gender
pic
resume (cover letter and an experience rating)

each employee will also have hidden attributes:

(array of attributes that effect happiness/prodoctivity levels)
