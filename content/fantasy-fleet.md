Putting out an ad or contacting a hiring agency will provide the player (in time) with an array of possible employees you can hire. Their driver's licence will be among the items that will be provided. The headshot of each prospective employee will generated by Dall-e, If they can ever get their API up and going.    


I plan to create a way of randomizing the prompt that is given. perhaps when a player first puts out an ad, a list of 4-8 people are generated and then presented after a time.


An employee will have the following attributes:

- name
- age
- gender
- pic
- resume (cover letter and an experience rating)

each employee will also have hidden attributes:

- (array of attributes that effect happiness/prodoctivity levels)
